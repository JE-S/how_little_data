## Data and code to make figures
The resulting data used for the article as well as scripts to produce the figures of the paper are available in Dryad Digital Repository at  
http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3jg57

## Structure of code
The code is structured in the following way:

The directory "phasediagrams_code" contains code to run all phase diagram simulations and process results into phase diagram results ready for display. The directory "largescale" contains code and data to run all large-scale simulations including the walnuts reconstructions. See READMEs in each directory for further details.
